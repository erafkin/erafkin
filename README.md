I am a data scientist and software engineer at JHU/APL, as well as a Master's student in the Computational Linguistics program at Georgetown Univerity. I am interested in ML, NLP, low-resource languages, and sociolinguistics. I sometimes make web and mobile applications in my free time, so most of these projects are just for fun!
